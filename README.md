# JavaScript Assignment (Chapters 21–30)

This project contains my JavaScript practice work for **Chapters 21 to 30** from the book *A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript*.  
The assignment covers two main topics:

### ✔ String Methods (Chapters 21–25)
- concat()
- replace()
- replace with regex
- string to number conversion
- uppercase / titlecase
- split()
- searching and validation

### ✔ Math Methods (Chapters 26–30)
- round(), floor(), ceil()
- absolute values
- random numbers
- dice and coin simulation
- secret number game
- parseFloat() usage

All questions are solved in simple JavaScript and connected through an HTML file.
